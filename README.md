### About me

I am a Research Assistant and Ph.D. Candidate in Physics in the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

I study large-scale structure and cosmology using large-area sky surveys, weak gravitational lensing, machine learning, statistics, and supercomputers. I work on the Dark Energy Survey and am a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration focused on data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
